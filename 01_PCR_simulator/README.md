# PCR Simulator

This project simulates one cycle of PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), a method used to amplify DNA.

## What it Does

- Loads a DNA sequence from a `.fasta` file
- Checks for primer binding (annealing)
- Simulates strand extension from the primer

## Why it Matters

The PCR is a fundamental tool in molecular biology, and this project shows:
- String handling with DNA sequences
- File I/O
- Logic control with basic Python

## Tools Used

- Python
- Basic file handling
- DNA sequence logic

## Files

- `pcr_simulator.py` - main script
- `example_input.fasta` - sample DNA
- `README.md` - this file

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Download or close this repository.
3. Navigate to the folder:
    cd projects/01_PCR_simulator
4. Run the script: 
    python pcr_simulator.py
