# Portfolio by BeYoung Kim

Hello. My name is BeYoung Kim, a student exploring biology, programming, and engineering in hopes to make the world a better place.
This portfolio shows the projects that I have built to practice my skills in real-world situations, from biology simulation to data vizualiation. Thank you for stopping by.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate and practice my ability to solve biology-related problems using code and technology.
Each project includes working code, sample data, and a write-up explaining what I have thought throughout the process and the lessons that I have learned from it.
